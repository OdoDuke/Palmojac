# System Requirements to Run the Website on PC and from GitHub

To ensure a smooth experience while running the website on your PC or accessing it from GitHub, please ensure that your system meets the following basic requirements:

## For PC:

1. **Operating System**: Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12 Sierra or later, or a modern Linux distribution.
2. **Web Browser**: Install the latest version of a modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, or Apple Safari.
3. **Internet Connection**: An active and stable internet connection is necessary to fetch external resources like stylesheets and scripts, and to access online content if applicable.
4. **Code Editor**: For customization purposes, you'll need a code editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, or any other of your choice.

## For GitHub Access:

If you want to access the website directly from GitHub, the system requirements are similar to those mentioned above. However, as you'll be accessing the website through a web browser, the code editor requirement won't be necessary.

1. **Web Browser**: Ensure you have a compatible web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, or Apple Safari) with the latest updates installed.
2. **Internet Connection**: A stable internet connection is required to load the website from GitHub servers.

## Browser Compatibility:

The website has been designed and tested to work on modern web browsers with up-to-date technology support. It should function correctly on the latest versions of the following browsers:

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- Apple Safari

Please note that older web browsers or versions that lack support for modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features may not render the website correctly or may experience reduced functionality.

## Additional Notes:

- JavaScript: While the website is designed with HTML and CSS, it's worth noting that if there are interactive features or functionality that rely on JavaScript, ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your web browser.
- Mobile Devices: The system requirements mentioned above are for desktop systems. While the website may work on mobile devices, it's optimized for larger screens, and some elements might not display perfectly on smaller screens.

By meeting these system requirements, you should be able to run and access the website seamlessly on your PC or directly from GitHub.
